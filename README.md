## Lyrics

```

let me remind you the blinded
forever on outside
defined through knot
they can't see
(that) i foresaw the beration
under false deeds
to question in vain
they don't really decide
what warning they'll heed
wrong triggers with (astound) no end
your're scarred yourself but you don't see
(and that's allright)

coded for lil hits ey
coded for lil hits

get your dopamine dopamine dopamine
get your dopamine dopamine dopamine
quick fix dopafiend quickfix

getyourdopa mine
getyourdopa mine
getyourdopa mine

getyourdopa mine
getyourdopa mine
getyourdopa mine
getyourdopa mine

get ya paws on treadmill
through a mall look left
selling bodies before souls
on your right drive-by took toll
nothing much (is) left

```
